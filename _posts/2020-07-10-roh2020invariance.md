We abstract traffic at intersections into a set of modes using a notion of topological invariance, and construct a Graph Neural Network based model (MTP) that conditions multiagent trajectory prediction on the likelihood of modes given observation of past behavior. MTP empowers a MPC to safely traverse uncontrolled intersections across a variety of challenging intersection scenarios on the CARLA simulator.
