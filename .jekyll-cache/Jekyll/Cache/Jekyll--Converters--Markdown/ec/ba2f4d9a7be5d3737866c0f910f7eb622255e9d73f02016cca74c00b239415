I"6<p>We use a LSTM-based architecture to learn a mapping from trajectories to a probability distribution over multiagent navigation strategies, encoded as topological braids. We show that this model enables non-communicating agents to coordinate efficienty across a seris of challenging simulated scenarios.</p>
